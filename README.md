# MyFileMovingService
A File moving service for my local network to help manage my files

Built a file downloader service that would take in a url or torrent magnet and would autodownload the file. Then after completion it would transfer over the file to a local SFTP server. I got tired of organizing the files so I had built a file watcher service to auto move them to certain directories and drives
